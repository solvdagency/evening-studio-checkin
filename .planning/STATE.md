# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-02)

**Core value:** Every evening the team gets one clear, trustworthy heads-up of exactly what needs fixing before tomorrow — so the three designers start the day with full, briefed workloads instead of chasing the work themselves.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Core Math & Clock

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Core Math & Clock)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-02 — Roadmap created (6 phases, coarse granularity, 25/25 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Build inside-out — deterministic core first, LLM last and cuttable; Phase 3 is the first genuinely shippable product (no LLM, no Calendar).
- [Roadmap]: All hour/capacity arithmetic stays in deterministic code (Phase 1); the LLM never does maths.
- [Roadmap]: "Briefed" is org-specific, not a native Productive field — confirmed via a mandatory live-data discovery spike in Phase 2 before brief flags are trusted.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Phase 4]: Google Calendar needs domain-wide delegation authorised by a Google Workspace admin (`calendar.readonly`). Confirm this external dependency before planning Phase 4.
- [Phase 5]: Production LLM cutover needs an org-sanctioned Anthropic API key. A personal $5-credit key covers dev/test. Phase 5 is cuttable if the key is not approved.
